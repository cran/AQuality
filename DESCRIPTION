Description: The function proposed in this package allows to graphically evaluate the process of measurement of the chemical components of water. The TSSS() function is useful to control the quality of measurements of chemical components of a sample of water. If one or more measurements include an error, the generated graph will indicate it with a position of the point that represents the sample outside the confidence interval.
