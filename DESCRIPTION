Description: The functions proposed in this package allows to evaluate the process of measurement of the chemical components of water numerically or graphically. TSSS() and ICHS functions are useful to control the quality of measurements of chemical components of a sample of water. If one or more measurements include an error, the generated graph will indicate it with a position of the point that represents the sample outside the confidence interval. The function CI allows to evaluate the possibility of contamination of a water sample after being obtained.
